# MesaTools
A module consisting of several useful tools for using MESA. Currently ill defined, but this is meant to contain the following

1. A means to create and access a database of MESA inlist commands (and possibly history/profile columns and maybe one day star info structure members)
2. The existing py_mesa_reader classes
3. Some as-yet unmade version of MesaScript for python
